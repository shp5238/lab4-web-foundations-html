# Issues
- it works on the web, but when i do local host, the download progress bar doesn't work. 
- i assume local host just ignores the JS or something. not sure how to overcome it without complicated code. 
- have to correctly organize everything later

- I know that in the HOME and ABOUT pages, the transparent box moves 
  in such a way that it reveals the background in the back in an 
  undesirable way. I do not have enough time to fix it. It probably
  needs more divs. 

- the colors do not work for USD in the about page. my-school tag colors arent rendering. IDK why. 

- why is the styling not showing up for the contact page? they should all be on top of each other. it renders on my local 
  environment, but not the local host. 
  - Note: the js for the contact page does not work. Intentionally no implementation because I would need more time. 

- again styling on product.html is confusing. I could spend more time and review why 
  it is not centering, but I don't have the time. 

FIXED
- THE LINKS do not not work. for some reason, they are clickable, but the page
  is poorly rendered. I need more time to fix this. FIXED
