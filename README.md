## Outstanding Issue

- **Product page:** Elements are not fully centered and require alignment adjustments.  

## Resolved Issues

- Navigation links are fully functional and navigate to the correct pages.  
- HOME and ABOUT pages render correctly, including background and layout behavior.  
- CONTACT page elements display stacked vertically as intended.  
- JavaScript functionality (except the product page progress bar) works as expected.  
- CSS styling is applied consistently across pages.  

## Notes
