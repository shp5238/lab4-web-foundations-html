# Issues
- it works on the web, but when i do local host, the download progress bar doesn't work. 
- i assume local host just ignores the JS or something. not sure how to overcome it without complicated code. 
- have to correctly organize everything later

- I know that in the HOME and ABOUT pages, the transparent box moves 
  in such a way that it reveals the background in the back in an 
  undesirable way. I do not have enough time to fix it. It probably
  needs more divs.
